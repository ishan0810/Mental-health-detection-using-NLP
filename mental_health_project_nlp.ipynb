I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms.

I would have listened in the past. I think it would be in my best interest to tell them I’m looking forward to it because I am. So, I am going to tell them that I’m excited to see them next week.

I read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. I feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and I often have a bloated stomach. I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. I also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that I'm fine and then I'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane.\n",

This isn’t minimizing what anyone else is saying, but this forum does provide me with a really good perspective on my own issues. Thank you to everyone who is willing to be vulnerable on here... having HA is painful, and opening up about it is even more painful.\n",

            "How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome? I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders? I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a \"money induced paralysis\". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this]( thread. It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort. I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind. I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?\n",
